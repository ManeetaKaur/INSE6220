Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method for lowering the dimensionality of such datasets, boosting interpretability while minimizing information loss. It accomplishes this by generating new uncorrelated variables that sequentially optimize variance. In this report, we classify the types of date fruit, which are, Berhi, Degle, Dokol, Iraqi, Rotana, Safavi, and Sogay by identifying appropriate classification algorithms that automate the classification by their external appearance features meeting the market requirements, using fruit characteristics/attributes. Dates come in a variety of shapes and sizes, each with its own set of characteristics. Date sorting is an important process in the dating industry, but it can be a time-consuming task. For this reporting purpose, we have considered 600 recordings, with a total of 7 features each. Four different types of classifiers are applied to the dataset: Random Forest Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall. The decision boundaries are created to provide insight into how the models fit the data. On the transformed and reduced data sets, the Random Forest Classifier algorithm is found to perform the best. Top accuracies ranged between 84% and 89%.
